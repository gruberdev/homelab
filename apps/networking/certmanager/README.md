```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruberdev/homelab/main/apps/argocd/base/networking/cert-manager.yaml -n argocd
```

### Important notes regarding ArgoCD deployment

> - The [application ArgoCD file for External-DNS][argocd-file] has `.spec.SyncOptions` value `ServerSideApply=true` set to `True`
>
> This fixes the following and similar errors related to recreating CRDs using ArgoCD:
>
> [`The ConfigMap is invalid: metadata.annotations: Too long: must have at most 262144 characters`][original-github-crd-issue]
>
> There's [an argument to be made `Replace=True` is faster when recreating large CRDs][github-discussion-crd-size], however, **this is not recommended to most CRDs**, as replacing resources tend to be more disruptive and generate unpredictable outcomes rather than using `ServerSideApply=true`.
