# ArgoCD

## Description

> ArgoCD is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that helps you keep your applications in sync with the desired state that you have defined in git. It uses a declarative configuration file to specify the desired state of your applications, and it continuously monitors the live state of your applications to ensure that they match the desired state. 
>
> With ArgoCD, you can easily manage and automate the deployment of your applications, making it easy to keep your applications up-to-date and consistent across different environments. 

## Reasons I chose ArgoCD over Flux

> - Built on top of Kubernetes, which means that it is natively integrated with the Kubernetes ecosystem and can take advantage of Kubernetes features such as RBAC and custom resource definitions.
> - Uses a declarative configuration file to specify the desired state of your applications, which makes it easier to manage and reason about the state of your applications.
> - Provides an intuitive web-based user interface that allows you to view and manage the state of your applications, which makes it easier to use and collaborate on with your team.
> - It also provides an API that allows you to integrate it with other tools and systems, which gives you more flexibility and allows you to automate your continuous delivery workflow.
Overall, ArgoCD offers a more robust and feature-rich solution for managing and automating the deployment of your applications on Kubernetes.
