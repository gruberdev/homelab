## Wavy

### Application Description

> Wavy makes it possible to run containerized GUI desktop applications — think Inkscape or Libreoffice — on Kubernetes and makes them accessible via the browser. This workflow allows users to run applications in the cloud and access them from any device without needing to install any software. Wavy works by patching Kubernetes Pods that are annotated with wavy.squat.ai/enable=true to include the necessary tools.
