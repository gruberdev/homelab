    An improved, potentially even perfected variant of MythoMix,
    my MythoLogic-L2 and Huginn merge using a highly experimental
    tensor type merge technique. The main difference with MythoMix
    is that I allowed more of Huginn to intermingle with the single
    tensors located at the front and end of a model, resulting in
    increased coherency across the entire structure.
