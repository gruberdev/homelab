### Description

> Mayastor is an open-source project aimed at enhancing the performance and scalability of cloud-native storage solutions. It's part of the larger OpenEBS initiative, designed specifically for Kubernetes environments. The core idea behind Mayastor is to utilize NVMe-oF (Non-Volatile Memory express over Fabrics) technology to provide high-speed data transfer rates and low latency storage operations.
>
> **I am using Mayastor as my main baremetal storage solution for my Talos Kubernetes cluster**
